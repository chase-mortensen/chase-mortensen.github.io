I discovered a new site called [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/) while listening to the [Stack Overflow Podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/). It's a great site for testing your javascript skills in a fun way. Essentially, you are given progressively more difficult scenarios and have to program one or more elevators to carry passengers to different floors in a given time limit.

I am going to be working through each of these levels and sharing how I tackle each challenge. By the end, I'm hoping to have a decent working elevator program. If you're interested in writing your own program, you can find the API documentation [here](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/documentation.html#docs).

What do you think? Let me know at chase@chase-mortensen.dev.
