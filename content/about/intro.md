## Hi, I'm Chase.

<br>
{{< figure src="/assets/about/graduation.jpg" >}}

Here's a few quick facts about me:
* I'm a musician, artist, uncle, skier, mountain biker, pickleballer, and, since January, vegan. 
* I love being outside and I've been trying to propagate succulents lately. 
* I've struggled to really get into any books for a while - I miss sitting down and reading for hours and not consciously thinking about the fact I'm reading every few minutes. Currently, I'm trying to get back into reading with [Good Omens](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Omens-Accurate-Prophecies-Nutter/dp/0060853980) - and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. 
* I binge-watched The Good Place and got a little teary-eyed during the final episode.

I am a recent computer science graduate from USU and I value simple, usable design. I took a variety of classes throughout my undergrad - from web development to parallel programming to data science. For almost my entire time at USU, I worked in the [Learn Explore Design (LED) Lab](https://learnexploredesign.org/). I had so many valuable experiences there and I miss working with everyone there. 

## Norman Doors

In the lab, I gained an appreciation for human-centered iterative design. One book that really affected me and the way I think about design was Don Norman's [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/). In the book, Norman discusses doors (known as Norman Doors) that are designed in a way where it isn't immediately clear how to open the door.

Once you learn about them, they seem to appear everywhere. I love what Norman says about a well-designed door in the video though - that you shouldn't even have to consciously think about the fact you are going through a door. It's completely natural.

Good software interactions are the same way - you shouldn't have to think twice or second guess yourself when using it. Unfortunately, there are a lot of Norman Door-esque interfaces that we encounter. Each of these interactions has a cost - it reduces the quality of the user experience and can cause the user to become frustrated or exit the software. 

Thankfully, these interactions can be improved through the iterative design process. I am passionate about and believe in this process and want to build rewarding, easy-to-use products.

## Resume

Here is a link to my [current resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6EZnqZ7fKQOiMqzuc861H2rILZMZI1M50QWzNnkzJc/edit?usp=sharing).

This site is a work in progress and will contain more information about me and my projects soon. Stay tuned!
