## Hi, I'm Chase.

I am a musician, artist, uncle, skier, mountain biker, pickleballer, and, since January, vegan. I am a recent computer science graduate from USU and I value simple, usable design.

Here is a link to my [current resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6EZnqZ7fKQOiMqzuc861H2rILZMZI1M50QWzNnkzJc/edit?usp=sharing).

This site is a work in progress and will contain more information about me and my projects soon. Stay tuned!
