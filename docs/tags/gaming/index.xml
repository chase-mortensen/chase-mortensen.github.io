      <description>Intro In 2016, I took a class called Digital Making and Learning that ultimately lead me to the Learn Explore Design Lab. This class was amazing and was where I first read Don Norman&amp;rsquo;s The Design of Everyday Things. I learned about feedback, signifiers, and many other aspects of human-centered design.
For my final project in the course, I wanted to make a mobile gaming device. I loved my Game Boy Advance when I was younger and wanted to recreate the experience I had with my own modern version.</description>
