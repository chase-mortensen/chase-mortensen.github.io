      <description>-- Challenge 1 Transport 15 people in 60 seconds or less (1 elevator, 3 floors) I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a very basic algorithm and hopefully progress to something that resembles real-life elevator behavior.
In order to move the elevator, I need the goToFloor function (see the documentation here). I&amp;rsquo;m going to start out by making an elevator that successively moves from the ground floor to the next floor and goes back to the ground floor when it reaches the top floor (Buddy the Elf-style).</description>

      <description>I discovered a new site called Elevator Saga while listening to the Stack Overflow Podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s a great site for testing your javascript skills in a fun way. Essentially, you are given progressively more difficult scenarios and have to program one or more elevators to carry passengers to different floors in a given time limit.
I am going to be working through each of these levels and sharing how I tackle each challenge.</description>

      <description>Current Project This project (code here) began as a simple to-do app. The user can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, as well as filter the list by pending, complete, or all tasks. It isn&amp;rsquo;t fully functional, but you can see a demo here. This project was built in Vue.js and is currently styled using vuetify. It is currently hosted using Firebase.

      <description>Intro FaceOverlay (also known as SmileyCluster) is an educational tool for machine learning under development in Dr. Zhen Bai&amp;rsquo;s lab at the University of Rochester. I was able to work on the project through an NSF-funded internship over the summer of 2019. Dr. Bai and her lab were amazing to work with and I learned a lot about iterative design and experiment design through that experience.
