      <description>Current Project This project (code here) began as a simple to-do app. The user can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, as well as filter the list by pending, complete, or all tasks. It isn&amp;rsquo;t fully functional, but you can see a demo here. This project was built in Vue.js and is currently styled using vuetify. It is currently hosted using Firebase.

      <description>Intro FaceOverlay (also known as SmileyCluster) is an educational tool for machine learning under development in Dr. Zhen Bai&amp;rsquo;s lab at the University of Rochester. I was able to work on the project through an NSF-funded internship over the summer of 2019. Dr. Bai and her lab were amazing to work with and I learned a lot about iterative design and experiment design through that experience.
