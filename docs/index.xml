      <description>-- Challenge 1 Transport 15 people in 60 seconds or less (1 elevator, 3 floors) I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a very basic algorithm and hopefully progress to something that resembles real-life elevator behavior.
In order to move the elevator, I need the goToFloor function (see the documentation here). I&amp;rsquo;m going to start out by making an elevator that successively moves from the ground floor to the next floor and goes back to the ground floor when it reaches the top floor (Buddy the Elf-style).</description>

      <title>How to Program an Elevator</title>

      <description>I discovered a new site called Elevator Saga while listening to the Stack Overflow Podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s a great site for testing your javascript skills in a fun way. Essentially, you are given progressively more difficult scenarios and have to program one or more elevators to carry passengers to different floors in a given time limit.
I am going to be working through each of these levels and sharing how I tackle each challenge.</description>

      <title>Tower: Git for Humans</title>

      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t start programming until college. When I first started, it was a lot to take in. The number of languages and technologies seemed innumerable (I think it feels even more so that way now).
Arguably, one of the most confusing technologies to learn was Git, which is a version control tool. It&amp;rsquo;s really an amazing tool - it allows users to track changes in files and collaborate with other users.</description>

      <description>This post is an introduction to the Web Vitals initiative from Google and why Web Vitals matter for your sites. Most of the content is summarized from Googleâ€™s articles on Web Vitals [1] and there are links throughout this article for further reading.
Part 1: What are Web Vitals and why do they matter? Your browser does not support the video tag.  Web Vitals are site metrics that measure some critical pillars of user experience.</description>

      <description>Current Project This project (code here) began as a simple to-do app. The user can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, as well as filter the list by pending, complete, or all tasks. It isn&amp;rsquo;t fully functional, but you can see a demo here. This project was built in Vue.js and is currently styled using vuetify. It is currently hosted using Firebase.

      <description>Intro In 2016, I took a class called Digital Making and Learning that ultimately lead me to the Learn Explore Design Lab. This class was amazing and was where I first read Don Norman&amp;rsquo;s The Design of Everyday Things. I learned about feedback, signifiers, and many other aspects of human-centered design.
For my final project in the course, I wanted to make a mobile gaming device. I loved my Game Boy Advance when I was younger and wanted to recreate the experience I had with my own modern version.</description>

      <description>Intro FaceOverlay (also known as SmileyCluster) is an educational tool for machine learning under development in Dr. Zhen Bai&amp;rsquo;s lab at the University of Rochester. I was able to work on the project through an NSF-funded internship over the summer of 2019. Dr. Bai and her lab were amazing to work with and I learned a lot about iterative design and experiment design through that experience.

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Chase.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a few quick facts about me:
 I&amp;rsquo;m a husband (as of August 2021!), musician, artist, uncle, skier, mountain biker, and avid pickleballer. I love being outside, traveling, and trying as many vegan restaurants as possible. Severance is currently my favorite show - if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, I highly recommend it! ðŸ¤™    I am a computer science graduate from USU and I value simple, usable design.</description>
